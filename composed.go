package serval

// A source made of several others.
//
// The fourth kind, and the second that wraps. It holds a sequence of named
// includes, each a source in its own right, and answers the scope out of all
// of them at once. Every record reaches the outer sequence under a key of its
// own -- the include's name, a slash, and the child's key -- so no two
// includes can collide however their own keys are spelled.
//
// Nothing shadows anything. Every record of every include is in the outer
// sequence under its own name, which is what separates this from the layering
// still ahead: that one replaces an inner record with an outer one of the same
// key, and here no two records can share a key at all.
//
// **The order is the include's name, then the child's key as the child itself
// orders it.** Within one include the name is constant, so the outer order and
// the child's own order are the same sequence -- which is what lets the merge
// below hand records on as they arrive instead of holding the answer to the
// end.
//
// There are no amendments here. One include may be an AmendedSource, or an
// AmendedSource may wrap the whole of this; either way the two stay separate
// and neither grows the other's job.
