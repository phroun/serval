// Runs of records the cache holds, and what it costs to hold them.
//
// A **cached scope** is a stretch of one data set that is guaranteed complete
// between its two ends: every record of the sequence falling between them is
// here, in order, with nothing missing. That is the same claim a watermark
// makes, which is why a scope's answer and a cache entry are the same object --
// what came back from one question is what can be handed to the next.
//
// Both ends are optional, and their absence is a stronger claim rather than
// ignorance. No beginning means from the start of the sequence; no end means to
// the end of it. So a source that ignores every hint, sends everything and says
// `exhausted` leaves one cached scope with neither end: the whole sequence,
// held entire, never asked for again.
//
// **The records are a doubly linked list, and the order is the data set's own.**
// A data set is a source, a sort and a filter, which is already an order, so
// there is no second one to invent and no ordinal to keep -- an entry's place is
// where its own values put it. Linked rather than laid out in order because of
// what happens to a run when the data changes underneath it: an insert splices
// one node in and cuts one link, and a merge joins one tail to one head, where
// an array would copy. Doubly linked because a scope can be read backwards, and
// because trimming the cold end off the back would otherwise walk the whole run
// to find the node before the last.
//
// Nothing is searched. An entry is found by identity in one lookup, and serving
// a scope is walking that many links from it -- forwards or backwards -- ending
// at the run's own end, which is exactly where the guarantee ends.

// The estimated cost of the parts a record is made of.
//
// These are for deciding when to evict, not for reporting memory, so what
// matters is that they are CONSISTENT rather than exact: an entry's cost is
// worked out once and kept, and eviction subtracts what insertion added. The
// total then cannot drift however wrong the estimate is, and being wrong only
// makes a byte limit nominal.
//
// The numbers are the real struct sizes rather than guesses -- a Value is
// 72 bytes, a Field 24, an entry 96 -- rounded up for the allocator's size
// class and the pointers that reach them. 0_cachedscope_test.go holds them to
// within a factor of the heap they model, and fails when the shape of what is
// held changes.
