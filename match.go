// own form can put one to a filter without copying it into ours first -- which
// for a filter that rejects it would be a copy made for nothing.

// A field the subject has not got reads as nil, which is `undefined`: a value
// with a rank of its own rather than an error. That is what makes a test
// against undefined a question about presence.
