// The cache of answered scopes, and which of them gives way when the room runs
// out.
//
// One cache for the whole process, holding runs of records belonging to many
// data sets. A scope's answer and a cached run are the same object -- complete
// between two ends -- so holding an answer is filing it, and answering from the
// cache is walking one that is already here. Nothing is re-derived: a run that
// meets another joins it, and a run asked for part of itself hands back a slice
// of its own links.
//
// # Keeping the hot records against a cold flood
//
// The thing an LRU cannot do is survive a scan. Recency is only a proxy for
// worth, and a walk that reads a million records and never looks back
// manufactures recency for free: every one of those records is the most
// recently used thing in the cache the moment it lands, and between them they
// push out everything that had actually proved itself. The records that were
// being used lose to records nothing ever wanted twice.
//
// So there are two segments, which is the standard answer (segmented LRU, or
// 2Q):
//
//   - Everything arrives on PROBATION. A record handed out once is no evidence
//     of anything -- a scan touches every record it passes exactly once.
//   - A record handed out a SECOND time is warm, and moves to the protected
//     segment.
//   - Eviction always takes from probation. Not preferentially: entirely. A
//     record that has proved itself is only ever touched once there is no
//     probationary record left anywhere in the cache to take, and it is that
//     rule a flood cannot get around, however many records it pours in.
//
// Two caps keep either segment from swallowing the cache:
//
//   - The protected segment is held under warmShare of the limit, so that what
//     has proved itself cannot fill the cache and leave no room to prove
//     anything else.
//   - One run's PROBATIONARY part is held under coldShare of the limit, and
//     that is the flood defence proper. A streaming answer is entirely cold, so
//     a run pouring in eats its own far end rather than the rest of the cache
//     once it passes the cap. It costs a large scan nothing it was going to use
//     anyway -- it never looks back -- and it costs everything else nothing at
//     all.
//
// A frequency sketch on top of this (TinyLFU: admit a record only if it scores
// better than the record it would evict, counting what has been ASKED for
// rather than what is held) is the stronger answer, and is what to reach for if
// measurement says these two are not enough. It is deliberately not here yet.
//
// # What is not here
//
// Invalidation. Entries carry a generation for it and runs can already be split
// and rejoined without re-querying, which is the machinery it will need, but
// nothing yet decides that a held record is stale.
//
// While that is true, the cache refuses to hold an answer overlapping records
// it already has: with no way to tell which copy is right, the one already
// filed is kept and the new answer is dropped rather than held twice. Runs
// carrying different fields are not an overlap -- those are different records
// as far as the cache is concerned, and coexist.
