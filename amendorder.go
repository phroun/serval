// An amended source's own records, put in order once per data set.
//
// What this source holds does not depend on who is reading it or on where they
// have scrolled to: the sort and the filter decide which of its amendments are
// in the sequence and where each one stands, and those two are what name a data
// set. So the work is done once for that sequence and every scope of it is a
// binary search into the result, rather than a copy of the whole lot, a filter
// pass and a sort, per scope.
//
// **The direction is not in it.** One order is walked either way, the same way
// one prepared ordering serves a reversed scope -- which is why `reversed`
// belongs to the scope and not to the sequence, and why this is keyed by the
// same thing the orderings are.
//
// Amendments change at any time, though, which orderings of records do not. So
// each order carries the generation it was built at, and a source that has been
// amended since builds a new one. Ordering can be a hint; membership cannot --
// an amendment added since would simply not be in a stale list, and would never
// go out.
