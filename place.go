// Where a record stood, remembered by whoever said so.
//
// A scope names its ends by identity, and an identity is not a position: it
// says which record, not where. A source that holds the records resolves one
// by looking it up. A source built on top of others cannot -- the records are
// somewhere else, and asking their owner "where is this?" is not a question the
// interface has -- so it remembers instead, as it hands each record on.
//
// The notes belong to the prepared sequence -- this source, this sort, this
// filter -- and not to any one reading of it. Those three are what decide which
// records are in a sequence and where they stand, so two readers naming the
// same three are reading the same sequence and a record stands in the same
// place for both. It is the same thing `dataSetKey` already dedupes an ordering
// by, and it is kept beside them for the same reason.
//
// That is not a cache of the data. It is a note of where this source put a
// record when it last said something about it, which is exactly what it needs
// to answer "and what comes after that one?" -- and it is bounded, because a
// reader that walks a million records should not leave a million notes behind.
